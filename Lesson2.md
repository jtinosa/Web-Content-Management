## The Web Content Management Team

From inception through launch and ongoing usage, a web content management project impacts several people throughout the organization, all with different roles and responsibilities.

The content management team is comprised of the combination of the following:

### Editors

Responsible for creating, editing, and managing the content.

The role can be divided based on the following:

- **Based on section/branch/location:** Editors might edit only a specific subset of content on the website. They might have complete control over the content in their specified area but no control over the content in other areas.
- **Based on content type:** Editors that can only edit specific types of content. Some editors are better defined by what content types they are more specialized in doing.

### Site Planners

Responsible for designing the website before the launch, with sporadic further involvement as the site develops and changes over time.

Several sub-roles include:

- **Content strategists:** Responsible for designing content, both holistically and tactically. Content strategists define the content types and interactions the website must support.
- **User experience (UX) designers and information architects:** Responsible for organizing content and designing the user’s interaction with the website.
- **Visual designers:** Responsible for the final, high-fidelity design of the website instead of lower-fidelity prototypes and user flows provided by previous roles.

### Developers

Responsible for installing, configuring, integrating, and templating the site. They are the programmers of the team.

- **Backend (server) developer:** Responsible for more low-level development performed in a traditional programming language (PHP, C#, Java, etc.) to accomplish more complex content management tasks.
- **Frontend (client) developer:** Responsible for creating HTML, JavaScript, template logic, and other code required to display managed content in a browser.

### Administrators

Responsible for the continued operation of the site and the management of the users. They can accept and reject permissions to the website.

Sub-roles include:

- **Server administrator:** Responsible for the maintenance and support of the servers. It is the traditional IT role that provides support when there is an underlying server issue.
- **Database/storage administrator:** Responsible for managing the database server and storage networks.


## Skills in Web Content Management

Now that the team and their responsibilities are identified, these are the following skills needed in web content management.

**Skills** – expertise or talent needed to do a job or task.

### Writing Aptitude

Well-crafted text, especially headlines and subtitles, draw a visitor's attention and allows the web content manager to connect with their potential audience.

### Technical Skills

The more technically knowledgeable a web content manager is, the better. A website’s content is written in HTML and displayed using CSS, so familiarity with markup and presentation makes for a better web content manager.

### Analytics Skills

By understanding the website analytics, the content manager can use the information extracted from the data to better target, reach, and serve their audience.

### Time Management & Planning

Content managers should have well-established time management, planning, and communication skills as they will be responsible for creating new content and reviewing and updating old or underperforming content.

### New Media Proficiency

Web content managers proficient with multi-channel media tools will be more successful at achieving their goal by taking advantage of additional communication channels.

### Understanding Marketing Personas

Web content managers must understand the needs and desires of their targeted audience to create content that will resonate.

### Understanding of UI/UX Design

A website’s content manager crawls through its pages and has a front-row seat to possible usability issues. Understanding what website elements are user-friendly and the reasons why is an invaluable resource.

## The Challenges

Keeping a website running takes a lot of effort, including the challenges that specific skills cannot quickly resolve.

1. **Keeping the site up and responsive:** To combat slower load times due to the increase of the size of the site and keep users on your site, a content manager must test the site frequently across a variety of devices and browsers.
2. **Managing videos:** A content manager should work with their creative teams to generate exciting content. This aspect can be challenging since videos take time and money to produce.
3. **Engaging with other brands:** Content managers should reach out to other brands to increase engagement. The web content manager needs to thoroughly review the profile of the different brands and influencers to avoid possible problems.
4. **Audience communication:** Content managers should communicate with their audience to further develop the site and prevent the site from experiencing drastic changes.
5. **Lack of general skills:** Content managers might face challenges on skills they do not currently possess that could hinder their managing web content.

## Factors in Determining Web Content Type, Platform, and Role

Choosing the right web content type, platform, and role at the beginning of web content development is significant and essential to the web content’s future.

### Finding the Web Content Type:

- **Based on Popularity:** Choose a popular web content type that can easily give your web content audience and visibility.

### Finding the Platform:

- **Based on Preference:** Consider platforms that you already know about to have more time developing the web content.
- **Based on Target Audience:** Consider platforms based on the web content type you chose. Blogging works better on Wordpress.org than other social media sites, for instance.

### Finding the Role:
